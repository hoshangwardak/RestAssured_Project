Day 1

-   When it comes to assertion in JUnit 5, you'll have to the static import of junit jupiter
    "import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;" If you don't want to do this static
    import everytime just put a * at the end instead of the method.

-   assertEquals has one particular version where you can add the error message at the end

-   Life cycle annotations
